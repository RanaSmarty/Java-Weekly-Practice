    Import Scanner package

        Display a greeting message to the user
        Create Scanner object to prompt user
        Request a statement from the user that they would want to know the vowels in.
        Read the sentence that was entered by the user and save it in a variable

        Initialize a new variable to keep track of vowel count and set it to 0
        Convert the statement to lowercase to make checking easier

        Set an index and initialize it to 0
        WHILE index < length of statement
            DO:
                IF  THEN
                END IF
        END WHILE
    Close the Scanner object to avoid resources leaks
