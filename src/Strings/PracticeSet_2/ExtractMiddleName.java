/**
 * Practice Problem 5: Extract Middle Name (Optional Challenge)
 *
 * Problem Statement:
 *
 * Write a Java program that:
 * Prompts the user to enter their full name (first, middle, and last name — all separated by spaces).
 * Extracts and prints the middle name (the part between the first and second space).
 * If the input does not contain at least two spaces, print: "Middle name not found!"
 *
 * Sample Input:
 * Enter your full name: John Michael Doe
 *
 * Sample Output:
 * Middle name: Michael
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Use only `indexOf()` and `substring()`
 * - No loops, no arrays, no split()
